# PortfolioWebsite
This is my portfolio website. This repo will allow anyone who comes here to see how I've built and slowly evolved my portfolio site. 
This file will be updated as I update the website and will serve as a soft updates list.


Currently what I want to do with my site:
1. Mobile Friendly
2. Landing Page
    - Navigation
    - Top landing section (Possibly a video of some sort?)
    - About Me Section (This including skills and certs and education)
    - Projects Section (This including both web and games)
    - Contact Section
